# Snapdrop for Firefox (Addon)
runs Snapdrop in the background so you can send to your browser and get notifications 

by default it just shows an iframe in a popup so you can revice files easily,
sending does not work. The background mode can be activated in the addon settings and the extension restarted by clicking on the icon.
