# Snapdrop for Firefox (Addon)
Share files between devices in your local network.

By default this addon just displays an <b>popup</b> with the Snapdrop website so you can start recieving files/texts easily.

<b>Background mode</b>
<br>
<i>can be enabled in the settings</i>
<br>
This runs Snapdrop in the background so you can send files/texts anytime and get notifications. If you click on the icon, Snapdrop is opened so you can also send.

ATTENTION
make sure that Snapdrop is only running once.
(The background service is stopping if Snapdrop is opened in any tab, just make sure not to open Snapdrop in several tabs)
